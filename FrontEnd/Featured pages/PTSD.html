    <h2>What Is PTSD?</h2>
    <p>
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that arises after experiencing or witnessing an extremely distressing or terrifying event. It doesn‚Äôt only affect war veterans or accident survivors ‚Äî PTSD can affect anyone whose mind and body were overwhelmed by something deeply painful. The condition often results in flashbacks, disturbing memories, difficulty sleeping, emotional numbness, or intense reactions to reminders of the trauma. These symptoms aren‚Äôt a weakness; they‚Äôre a response from a mind trying to make sense of the unthinkable.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ptsd-card">
    <h2>It‚Äôs More Common Than You Think</h2>
    <p>
      PTSD doesn't come in one shape or form. It might develop after a car accident, a physical assault, childhood neglect, or even prolonged exposure to emotional abuse. Some people experience trauma as children and develop symptoms years later without realizing the connection. Others might develop PTSD from medical emergencies, natural disasters, or seeing a loved one in danger. The truth is, trauma is personal ‚Äî and if it hurt you, it mattered.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ptsd-card">
    <h2>‚ÄúI Wasn‚Äôt Broken. I Was Hurting.‚Äù</h2>
    <blockquote>
      ‚ÄúEvery time I heard a door slam, my heart would race and my vision would blur. It took me a long time to realize that I wasn‚Äôt crazy ‚Äî my mind was reacting as if the trauma was happening all over again. Therapy didn‚Äôt erase the memories, but it helped me feel safe again.‚Äù<br>
      <cite>‚Äì Arun, PTSD survivor</cite>
    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="ptsd-card">
    <h2>What Happens Inside the Brain?</h2>
    <p>
      PTSD physically changes how your brain responds to danger. The amygdala, the region responsible for fear, becomes hyper-alert ‚Äî always scanning for threats. The hippocampus, which helps us distinguish past from present, may shrink or underperform, leading to confusion and flashbacks. The prefrontal cortex, which normally calms the amygdala down, becomes less active. This means people with PTSD aren‚Äôt choosing to overreact ‚Äî their brain is stuck in survival mode, even when they‚Äôre safe.
    </p>

  <div class="ptsd-card">
    <h2>How It Shows Up</h2>
    <p>
      PTSD doesn‚Äôt always scream for attention. Sometimes it whispers ‚Äî in the form of emotional numbness, disconnection from loved ones, or overwhelming guilt. People may avoid certain places, sounds, or people because they unknowingly resemble the original trauma. Others find themselves angry for no reason, unable to sleep, or constantly on edge. These symptoms can make daily life feel exhausting and unpredictable, and many suffer silently for years.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ptsd-card">
    <h2>Facing the Myths</h2>
    <p>
      One of the biggest misconceptions is that PTSD only happens to soldiers or people involved in violence. In reality, emotional wounds can be just as damaging as physical ones. Another false belief is that people with PTSD are dangerous or unstable ‚Äî when in truth, most are simply trying to feel safe again. And no, you can‚Äôt ‚Äújust get over it.‚Äù Healing from PTSD isn‚Äôt about forgetting; it‚Äôs about regaining control and creating safety in your mind and body again.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ptsd-card">
    <h2>Pathways to Healing</h2>
    <p>
      The road to recovery can look different for everyone. Some find relief through therapy approaches like Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), which helps untangle unhelpful thought patterns tied to trauma. Others benefit from EMDR ‚Äî a process that uses eye movements to reprocess traumatic memories and reduce their emotional charge. Many combine talk therapy with medication, such as SSRIs, to manage anxiety and depression symptoms. What matters most is finding what works for you ‚Äî and remembering that healing isn‚Äôt linear.

  <div class="ptsd-card">
    <h2>When the Past Intrudes</h2>
    <p>
      Flashbacks and emotional overwhelm are common, but there are ways to ground yourself. One technique involves using your senses ‚Äî name things you can see, feel, or hear around you to anchor you in the present. Another method is holding an ice cube, touching something textured, or splashing cold water on your face. Music, scent, and breath can all be powerful anchors too. These grounding practices don‚Äôt erase trauma, but they offer brief moments of calm amidst the storm.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ptsd-card">
    <h2>The Power of Support</h2>
    <p>
      Whether it‚Äôs a trusted friend, a therapist, or a peer support group ‚Äî connection is key. If you love someone with PTSD, the most helpful thing you can offer is presence and patience. Don‚Äôt rush them to talk or push them to be ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù Instead, ask what feels supportive, listen without judgment, and create a safe space where they can just exist. The road may be long, but no one should walk it alone.

  <div class="ptsd-card crisis-box">
    <h2>When It Feels Too Much</h2>
    <p>
      PTSD can feel heavy ‚Äî but help is never out of reach. If you or someone you know is in crisis, reach out. In India, the Mental Health Helpline (Kiran) is available at 1800-599-0019. You can also access international support via the Crisis Text Line or platforms like NAMI. A moment of courage to call or text can begin a new chapter of healing.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ptsd-card closing-thought">
    <h2>You Are Not Defined by What Hurt You</h2>
    <p>
      Living with PTSD is a testament to your strength ‚Äî not your brokenness. The fact that you‚Äôre still here, still breathing, still trying, speaks volumes. Healing is possible, even when it feels out of reach. Be kind to yourself, ask for help when needed, and celebrate small wins. Each step forward is a radical act of courage. You are more than your past ‚Äî and your story isn‚Äôt over.
